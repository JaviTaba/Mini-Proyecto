Hello world!

This is a solo project to practice the skills I'm learning in AI Development.

The idea is to build a digital version of myself, who my closest friends can feed with information about our relationships and can generate meaningful and nice
conversations about our memories.

Some of the features I intend to develop: 
  -Face recognition to learn to recognize my friends
  -IA trained voice to talk like me
  -IA trained video to look like me
  -Ability to ask questions and store information
  -Ability to bring up personalized topics of conversation
  
  
A bit of the architecture I (and ChatGPT) think I could use:
  -A database in SQLite3 Python
  -Language Model with NLTK library
  -Facial recognition with OpenCV
  -User Interface with Tkinter or PyQT
  -Code Integrating Models with PyTorch or TensorFlow
  -Avatar generation with MirrorAI's API
